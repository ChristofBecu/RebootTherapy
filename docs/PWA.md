# PWA Implementation

## What's Been Added

Your Reboot Therapy blog is now a Progressive Web App (PWA)! This means users can install it as an app on their devices.

### Files Created:

1. **`src/public/manifest.json`** - Web app manifest with app metadata
2. **`src/public/sw.js`** - Service worker for offline functionality and caching
3. **`src/public/icon-192.png`** - 192x192 app icon
4. **`src/public/icon-512.png`** - 512x512 app icon

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/index.html`** - Added PWA manifest links and meta tags
2. **`src/scripts/main.js`** - Added service worker registration
3. **`netlify.toml`** - Added headers for service worker and manifest

## Features

- âœ… Installable on desktop and mobile devices
- âœ… Offline caching for faster loading
- âœ… App-like experience with standalone display mode
- âœ… Custom app icons
- âœ… Theme color matching your site's dark theme

## Testing After Deployment

1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Open your site in Chrome or Edge
3. Look for the install icon (âŠ•) in the address bar
4. Click it to install as an app!

### Testing Locally

You can also test the PWA locally:

```bash
# Install a local server if you don't have one
npm install -g http-server

# Serve the src directory
cd /home/bedawang/dev/projects/RebootTherapy
http-server src -p 8080

# Open http://localhost:8080 in Chrome
# Note: Service workers require HTTPS in production, but work on localhost for testing
```

### Lighthouse Audit

After deployment, you can check your PWA score:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App" category
4. Click "Generate report"

## Browser Support

- âœ… Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Mobile) - Full support with install prompt
- âœ… Safari iOS - Add to Home Screen available
- âœ… Firefox - Basic PWA support
- âœ… Samsung Internet - Full support

## Cache Strategy

The service worker uses a "Cache First" strategy:
- Static assets are cached on first visit
- Subsequent visits load instantly from cache
- New content is fetched in the background and cached for next time

## Updating the App

When you make changes:
1. Update the `CACHE_NAME` version in `src/public/sw.js` (e.g., 'reboot-therapy-v2')
2. This will force the service worker to update and clear old caches
3. Users will get the new version on their next visit

Enjoy your new installable blog! ðŸš€
