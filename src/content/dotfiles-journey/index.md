# 🔧 Control Freak: Dotfiles

*A chronicle of chaos, control, and the illusion thereof.*

This is a living record of my dotfiles — the digital fingerprints of my sanity (or what's left of it). Every commit, every micro-adjustment, every late-night ```git push``` born out of frustration and caffeine is documented here in real time, straight from GitHub.

## What Are Dotfiles?

Think of dotfiles as the DNA of your computer’s personality — those unassuming little files that start with a ```.``` and somehow control *everything*.

They decide how your shell greets you in the morning, how your editor behaves when you mistype a command, and whether your window manager treats you kindly or like an emotionally unavailable roommate.

## Why Bother Tracking Them?

Because entropy demands structure — or at least the illusion of it.

My dotfiles are a meditation on continuous improvement (and occasional regression). Each commit marks a small step in the eternal loop of:

- Discovering a tool that promises productivity salvation
- Breaking everything by integrating it
- Fixing what I broke, but slightly worse
- Copy-pasting wisdom from strangers on GitHub
- Declaring “finally stable” before inevitably tweaking again

## Live Commit History

Below lies the unfiltered stream of change — a live feed of my dotfiles’ ongoing evolution, fetched straight from GitHub.

Each entry links directly to its source — a breadcrumb trail through the forest of configuration obsession.

Clone it. Fork it. Mock it. Or just stare at it and whisper: *“same.”*
